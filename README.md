# LADX-Source_Code
Official Source Code of Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening DX

From 2018-2021, a huge wave of Nintendo leaks nicknamed the "Gigaleaks" was posted online which contained 
many top secret infomation ranging from game and console source code to internal documentation 
and development tools. Included within all the mess was the Source Code to The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX
released in 1998 for the Nintendo Game Boy Color system in every language that it was made in. However, in its raw 
state it is very confusing to set up which this archive fixes. Other then that, all the source code within is 
untouched and produces 1:1 copies of the ROMs which can be changed to your heart's desire.

The source archive in the leaks is titled AZL__ゼルダの伝説 夢を見る島DX split in three different "Disk" folders

To set up, just download the repository and run the *cgal.bat* file in each folder. The output should be a 
.gb and .sym file.

# TODO

German and Franch versions will be added soon, and so will ROM hashes for each version
